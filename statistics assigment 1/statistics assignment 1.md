# Problem Statement 3:

The number of times I go to the gym in weekdays, are given below along with its
associated probability:
    
x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

f(x) = 0.09, 0.15, 0.40, 0.25, 0.10, 0.01

Calculate the mean no. of workouts in a week. Also evaluate the variance involved in
it.

# Problem Statement 4:

Let the continuous random variable D denote the diameter of the hole drilled in an
aluminum sheet. The target diameter to be achieved is 12.5mm. Random
disturbances in the process often result in inaccuracy.Historical data shows that the distribution of D can be modelled by the PDF (d) =
20e−20(d−12.5), d ≥ 12.5. If a part with diameter > 12.6 mm needs to be scrapped,what is the proportion of those parts? What is the CDF when the diameter is of 11
mm? What is your conclusion regarding the proportion of scraps?

$\text{Proportion that a part with diameter > 12.5mm needs to be scraped is:}$

$\begin{equation}
P(X>12.6)= \int_{12.6}^{\infty} 20e^{-20(x-12.5)} dx = \left[-e^{-20(x-12.5)}\right]_{12.6}^{\infty} = 0.135
\end{equation}$


$\text{CDF when diameter is 11mm is 0 since the PDF function is only applicable when d>=12.5 .}$

$\text{For proportion of scraps: P(12.5 < X < x) that is proportion that a particular diameter x lies between X ans 12.5}$

$\text{F(x) = 0 for x < 12.5}$

$\begin{equation} F(x)= \int_{12.5}^x 20e^{-20(u-12.5)} du = 1 - e^{-20(x-12.5)} \text{for x>= 12.5} \end{equation}$

$\begin{equation}
  F(x)=
    0, \text{if $x<12.5$ and }  1-e^{-20(x-12.5)}, \text{for x>=12.5}\end{equation}$
 
  $\text{where F(x) is P(12.5 < X < x)}$

<h3>Conclusion </h3>
<p>For any value of diameter less than 12.5 mm, the proportion of scraps is zero. For any value above 12.5 mm the proportion of scraps follow the equation: </p> $1-e^{-20(x-12.5)}$

# Problem Statement 5:

A company manufactures LED bulbs with a faulty rate of 30%. If I randomly select 6
chosen LEDs, what is the probability of having 2 faulty LEDs in my sample?
Calculate the average value of this process. Also evaluate the standard deviation
associated with it.

$\text{Let x be the faulty LEDs which is 2. Here n is 6 and p is 0.3(success i.e. faulty).}$
$\text{The probability that 2 will be faulty is:}$
$\text{P(X) = } {n \choose x}{p^x}{q^{n-x}} = {6 \choose 2}{(0.3)^2}{(0.7)^{6-2}}$

$\text{=15*0.09*0.2401 = 0.3241}$

$\text{Standard Deviation formula for binomial distribution is: }\sqrt{n*p*(1-p)}$


```python
#problem statement 5
from scipy.stats import binom

n = 6
p = 0.3
mean , var = binom.stats(n, p)
std = var**0.5
print('Mean is',mean)
print('Standard deviation for this process is',std)
```

    0.3257

    Standard deviation for this process is 1.1224972160321822


# Problem Statement 6:

Gaurav and Barakha are both preparing for entrance exams. Gaurav attempts to
solve 8 questions per day with a correction rate of 75%, while Barakha averages
around 12 questions per day with a correction rate of 45%. What is the probability
that each of them will solve 5 questions correctly? What happens in cases of 4 and 6
correct solutions? What do you infer from it? What are the two main governing
factors affecting their ability to solve questions correctly? Give a pictorial
representation of the same to validate your answer.

$\text{For Gaurav:}
\\
\text{Let x be the number of questions to solve 5. Number of questions he solves(n) is 8. Probability(p) i.e. the correction rate is 0.75.}$
$\begin{equation}
P(X) = {n \choose x}{p^x}{q^{n-x}} = {8 \choose 5}{(0.75)^5}{(0.25)^{8-5}}
\\
=56*0.2373*0.015625 = 0.2076
\end{equation}$

$\text{For Barkha:}
\\
\text{Let x be the number of questions to solve 5. Number of questions he solves(n) is 12. Probability(p) i.e. the correction rate is 0.45.}$
$\begin{equation}
P(X) = {n \choose x}{p^x}{q^{n-x}} = {12 \choose 5}{(0.45)^5}{(0.55)^{12-5}}
\\
=792*0.0185*0.015 = 0.223
\end{equation}$


```python
from scipy.stats import binom 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
# setting the values of n and p  
n_Gaurav = 8
p_Gaurav = 0.75
n_Barkha = 12

# defining list of r values

```python

print('Probability to solve',r_values_Barkha[6],'correctly for Barkha is', dist_Barkha[6])
print('Probability to solve',r_values_Gaurav[6],'correctly for Gaurav is', dist_Gaurav[6])
```

    Probability to solve 4 correctly for Barkha is 0.1699639321360581
    Probability to solve 4 correctly for Gaurav is 0.08651733398437506
    Probability to solve 6 correctly for Barkha is 0.21238468214026432
    Probability to solve 6 correctly for Gaurav is 0.31146240234375017


<p> The two main factors affecting the ability to solve questions correctly are:</p>
<li>Correction rate</li>
<li>Number of questions solved per day</li>

<p>As the correction rate increases the chances of the distribution to be left skewed increases. Since Barkha's correction rate is close to 0.5 so highest probability of solving questions is found at around 50% of the total number of questions.</p>
<p>Increasing the number of questions solved daily reduces skewness as well.As the number of questions increases the distribution skewness decreases</p>  

# Problem Statement 7:

customers arriving in 4 minutes? a) 5 customers, b) not more than 3 customers, c)
more than 3 customers. Give a pictorial representation of the same to validate your

# Problem Statement 8:

I work as a data analyst in Aeon Learning Pvt. Ltd. After analyzing data, I make
reports, where I have the efficiency of entering 77 words per minute with 6 errors per
hour. What is the probability that I will commit 2 errors in a 455-word financial report?
What happens when the no. of words increases/decreases (in case of 1000 words,
255 words)?
How is the λ affected?
How does it influence the PMF?
Give a pictorial representation of the same to validate your answer.

$$\text{Formula for poisson's distribution is:}
\begin{equation}
P(x) = \frac{e^{-\lambda}{\lambda}^x}{x!}
\end{equation}\\$$

$$\text{77 words per minute has 6 errors per hour that is 0.1 errorr per minute. }
\\
\text{So a 455 word report will have an average of 0.59 errors. So }{\lambda} 
\text{ is 0.59. We need probability of 2 errors. Hence x is 2.}
$$
$$\text{Substituting the values to formula we get:}
\begin{equation}
P(x) = \frac{e^{-0.59}{0.59}^2}{2!} = \frac{0.5543*0.3481}{2} = 0.0965
\end{equation}$$

$$\text{77 words per minute has 6 errors per hour that is 0.1 errorr per minute. }
\\
\text{So a 1000 word report will have an average of 1.299 errors. So }{\lambda}

$$
$$\text{Substituting the values to formula we get:}

P(x) = \frac{e^{-1.299}{1.299}^2}{2!} = \frac{0.2728*1.6874}{2} = 0.23
\end{equation}$$

$$\text{77 words per minute has 6 errors per hour that is 0.1 errorr per minute. }
\\
\text{So a 255 word report will have an average of 0.33 errors. So }{\lambda}

$$
$$\text{Substituting the values to formula we get:}
\begin{equation}
P(x) = \frac{e^{-0.33}{0.33}^2}{2!} = \frac{0.7189*0.1089}{2} = 0.04

Let the continuous random variable D denote the diameter of the hole drilled in an

disturbances in the process often result in inaccuracy.
Historical data shows that the distribution of D can be modelled by the PDF, f(d) =

what is the proportion of those parts? What is the CDF when the diameter is of 11

What is the conclusion of this experiment?

$$\text{Proportion that a part with diameter > 12.5mm needs to be scraped is:}

c) Find the value of z such that P(−z < Z < z) = 0.99

Using standard normal distriution tables to find the values,

# Problem Statement 12:

The shaft in a piston has its diameter normally distributed with a mean of 0.2508 inch
and a standard deviation of 0.0005 inch. The specifications of the shaft are 0.2500 ∓
0.0015 inch. What proportion of shafts are in sync with the specifications? If the
process is centered so that the mean is equal to the target value of 0.2500, what
proportion of shafts conform to the new specifications? What is your conclusion from
this experiment?

$$\text{Mean diameter is 0.2508 inch}
\\
\text{Standard deviation is 0.0005 inch}
\\
\text{Z-score for (0.2500 - 0.0015) 0.2485 is } \frac{0.2485-0.2508}{0.0005} = -4.6
\\
\text{Z-score for (0.2500 + 0.0015) 0.2515 is} \frac{0.2515-0.2508}{0.0005} = 1.4
\\
\text{We need to find P(-4.6< Z < 1.4)}
\\
= P(Z < 1.4) - P(Z < -4.6) =  0.92.
\\
\text{So, 0.92 of the shafts are in sync}$$

$$\text{If mean is 0.2500 then, }
\text{Z-score for (0.2500 - 0.0015) 0.2485 is } \frac{0.2485-0.2500}{0.0005} = -3
\\
\text{Z-score for (0.2500 + 0.0015) 0.2515 is} \frac{0.2515-0.2500}{0.0005} = 3
\\
\text{We need to find P(-3< Z < 3)}
\\
= P(Z < 3) - P(Z < -3) = 0.9973.
\\
\text{So, 0.997 of the shafts are in sync}
$$
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>So if we change the mean from 0.2508 to 0.2500 the proportion of shaft increases from 92% to 99.73% </p>
