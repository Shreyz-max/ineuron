# Problem Statement 1:

In each of the following situations, state whether it is a correctly stated hypothesis
testing problem and why?
1. H0: μ = 25, H1: μ ≠ 25
2. H0: σ > 10, H1: σ = 10
3. H0: x = 50, H1: x ≠ 50
4. H0: p = 0.1, H1: p = 0.5
5. H0: s = 30, H1: s > 30

1\.  H0: μ = 25, H1: μ ≠ 25 This is a correctly stated hypothesis testing problem. It is a two tailed test. It is correctly stated as H1 is the negation of H0. Also an alternate hypothesis is true only if μ is not equal to, greater or less than H0 μ.

2\.  H0: σ > 10, H1: σ = 10. This is not a correctly stated hypothesis testing problem as alternate hypothesis must contain some form of inequality like not equal to or less than or greater than relationships.

3\. H0: x = 50, H1: x ≠ 50. This is a correctly stated hypothesis testing problem. It is a two tailed test. It is correctly stated as H1 is the negation of H0. Also an alternate hypothesis is true only if H1 x is not equal to, greater or less than H0 x.

4\. H0: p = 0.1, H1: p = 0.5. This is not a correctly stated hypothesis testing problem as alternate hypothesis must contain some form of inequality like not equal to or less than or greater than relationships. Also this is not correct because the alternate hypothesis must be a negation of null hypothesis which is not true here.

5\. H0: s = 30, H1: s > 30. This is a correctly stated hypothesis testing problem. It is a right tailed test. It is correctly stated as H1 is the negation of H0. Also an alternate hypothesis is true only if H1 s is not equal to, greater or less than H0 s and here H1 s claims to be greater than H0 s.

# Problem Statement 2:

The college bookstore tells prospective students that the average cost of its
textbooks is Rs. 52 with a standard deviation of Rs. 4.50. A group of smart statistics
students thinks that the average cost is higher. To test the bookstore’s claim against
their alternative, the students will select a random sample of size 100. Assume that
the mean from their random sample is Rs. 52.80. Perform a hypothesis test at the
5% level of significance and state your decision.

$\underline{Hypothesis:}$

<li>$ \text{Null Hypothesis } H_{0} : \mu = 52 $

<li>$ \text{Alternate Hypothesis }H_{A} : \mu > 52 $

$\text{We will use z−test as the sample is large with a known population variance.}$

$\underline{Parameters:}$

<li>$ \mu = 52$

<li>$ \sigma = 4.50$ 

<li>$ \bar{x} = 52.80$

<li>$ n = 100 $

$\underline{Significance}$

$ \alpha = 0.05$

$\text{Formula for test statistic is: }$
$\begin{equation}
z = \frac{\bar{x} − \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}\end{equation}$

$\begin{equation}
z = \frac{52.80 − 52}{\frac{4.50}{\sqrt{100}}}
= 1.78\end{equation}$

$\text{P-value for z is 1 − } \phi{(z)} \text{ = 1 − 0.962 = 0.038 for right−tailed test}$

$\text{Since P-value is less than alpha we will reject the null hypothesis }H_{0} \text{ in favour of alternate hypothesis }H_{1}$
<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p style='font-size:120%'>The hypothesis that the average cost of textbooks is Rs 52 is rejected in favour of the hypothesis that average cost is more than Rs 52.</p>

# Problem Statement 3:

A certain chemical pollutant in the Genesee River has been constant for several
years with mean μ = 34 ppm (parts per million) and standard deviation σ = 8 ppm. A
group of factory representatives whose companies discharge liquids into the river is
now claiming that they have lowered the average with improved filtration devices. A
group of environmentalists will test to see if this is true at the 1% level of
significance. Assume that their sample of size 50 gives a mean of 32.5 ppm.
Perform a hypothesis test at the 1% level of significance and state your decision.

$\underline{Hypothesis:}$

<li>$ \text{Null Hypothesis } H_{0} : \mu = 34 $

<li>$ \text{Alternate Hypothesis }H_{A} : \mu < 34 $

$\text{We will use z−test as the sample is large with a known population variance.}$

$\underline{Parameters:}$

<li>$ \mu = 34$

<li>$ \sigma = 8$ 

<li>$ \bar{x} = 32.5$

<li>$ n = 50 $

$\underline{Significance}$

$ \alpha = 0.01$

$\text{Formula for test statistic is: }\begin{equation}
z = \frac{\bar{x} − \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}\end{equation}$

$\begin{equation}
z = \frac{32.5 − 34}{\frac{8}{\sqrt{50}}}
= −1.325\end{equation}$

$\text{P-value for z is } \phi{(z)} \text{ = 0.0907 for left−tailed test}$

$\text{Since P-value is less than alpha we will reject the null hypothesis }H_{0} \text{ in favour of alternate hypothesis }H_{1}.$

<h3>Conclusion:</h3> 
<p style='font-size:120%'>Since the null hypothesis is rejected, the claim of the companies that they have lowered the average is infact true.</p>

# Problem Statement 4:

Based on population figures and other general information on the U.S. population,
suppose it has been estimated that, on average, a family of four in the U.S. spends
about $1135 annually on dental expenditures. Suppose further that a regional dental
association wants to test to determine if this figure is accurate for their area of
country. To test this, 22 families of 4 are randomly selected from the population in
that area of the country and a log is kept of the family’s dental expenditure for one
year. The resulting data are given below. Assuming, that dental expenditure is
normally distributed in the population, use the data and an alpha of 0.05 to test the
dental association’s hypothesis.

$\text{For a significance level of 5% on two tailed test for 21 degree of freedom the critical value is }\pm2.08$

$\text{Since test statistic does not lie in the rejection region we will not reject the null hypothesis.}$

# Problem Statement 5:

In a report prepared by the Economic Research Department of a major bank the
Department manager maintains that the average annual family income on Metropolis
is \$48,432. What do you conclude about the validity of the report if a random sample

# Problem Statement 6:

Suppose that in past years the average price per square foot for warehouses in the
United States has been \$32.28. A national real estate investor wants to determine
whether that figure has changed now. The investor hires a researcher who randomly
samples 19 warehouses that are for sale across the United States and finds that the
mean price per square foot is \$31.67, with a standard deviation of \$1.29. assume
that the prices of warehouse footage are normally distributed in population. If the
researcher uses a 5% level of significance, what statistical conclusion can be
reached? What are the hypotheses?

$\chi^{2} = \sum{\frac{(Observed − Expected)^{2}}{Expected}}$

$\begin{equation}= \frac{(679 − 654.06)^{2}}{654.06} + \frac{(103 − 109.29)^{2}}{109.29} + \frac{(114 − 132.65)^{2}}{132.65} + \frac{(63 − 67.89)^{2}}{67.89} + \frac{(10 − 11.34)^{2}}{11.34} + \frac{(20 − 13.77)^{2}}{13.77} + \frac{(42 − 62.05)^{2}}{62.05} + \frac{(18 − 10.37)^{2}}{10.37} + \frac{(25 − 12.58)^{2}}{12.58} = 31.61\end{equation}$

$\text{For α = 0.05 and degrees of freedom 4, the critical value is 9.49.}$

$\text{Since 9.49 < 31.61 the value lies in the rejection region. We will reject the null hypothesis }H_{0}.$

<h3>Conclusion:</h3> 
<p style='font-size:120%'>Since the null hypothesis is rejected, we can conclude that for a significance of 5% there is a relationship between marital status and labour force status.</p>
